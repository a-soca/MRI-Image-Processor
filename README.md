## Aims
This MATLAB application simulates the affect of different magnetic field strengths and voxel sizes on the contrast and resolution of an MRI image.
The source image is assumed to be at B0 1.5T and Voxel size 1.5mm^3

## Features
- Original/Processed image comparison
- Clipping prevention button
- Highlight compensation slider to retain details in case of overexposure or to focus on specific sections of within the altered dynamic range

The user has control over the following parameters :
- Magnetic field strength (B0) in T
- Voxel size in mm^3
- Highlight compensation
